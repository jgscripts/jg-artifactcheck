# FiveM Artifact Checker (Standalone)

A tiny resource that checks your server artifact version every time it starts & displays a warning if there is a known issue and an update is recommended.

This can be used as a standalone resource in your server (just download & drag into your `resources` folder), or you can just steal the code and use it within your resources.

This resource makes a network request to the [FiveM Artifacts DB API](https://artifacts.jgscripts.com).
